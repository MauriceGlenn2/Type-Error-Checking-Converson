# Type-Error-Checking-Converson Basics

# Learning Type Errors, Checking, and Conversion

I'm currently learning how to work with **type errors**, **type checking**, and **type conversion** in Python. This includes understanding how different data types behave, identifying and fixing type-related bugs, and using functions like `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` to convert between types.

## Practice Code

```python
name_of_user = input("Enter your name")
length_of_name = len(name_of_user)

print("Number of letters in your name: " + str(length_of_name))
